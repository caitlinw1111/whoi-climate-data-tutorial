# Climate data analysis @ WHOI: a tutorial
The purpose of this tutorial is to provide practical guidance on how to analyze gridded climate data (e.g., reanalysis products and climate model output) using python and data stored on WHOI's servers. The tutorial is designed to take place over 5-6 days, and is split into two parts. In the first part, we'll assess climate change in a region of their choice by comparing historical and pre-industrial control simulations. In the second part, we'll attempt to reproduce results from a recent paper which used the last-millenium ensemble$^1$.

## Set up
#### Virtual environment
1. Set up mamba or conda (if not already). To set up, download and install miniforge following the instructions here: https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge.
2. Create a project folder; e.g., with ```mkdir ~/cmip_tutorial``` and navigate to the project with ```cd ~/cmip_tutorial```
3. Create a conda/mamba environment for the project with: ```mamba create -p ./envs``` and activate the environment with ```conda activate ./envs```
4. Install necessary packages in the environment with ```mamba env update -p ./envs --file environment.yml```

## Accessing the climate data servers
- Windows and (non-Mac) Linux users: follow [online instructions for CMIP5](http://cmip5.whoi.edu/?page_id=40) or [for CMIP6](http://cmip6.whoi.edu/?page_id=50).
- Mac users: for CMIP6, open Finder, then select "Go" from the top menu bar and click "Connect to Server". Then, enter ```smb://vast.whoi.edu/proj/cmip6```. If prompted, enter your WHOI username (*without* "@whoi.edu") and password. Note the default mount location for the server is ```/Volumes/data```. For CMIP5, use the same process but with the following server address: ```smb://cmip5.whoi.edu```.
